#Automata Simulation
This project was founded to facilitate the understanding and learning of the automatatheory for students.
This application is a project as a part of the informaticsproject in the 5th semester at the technical university
of cologne. Automata-Simulation stands for modelling and simulating of automata from the automatatheory. Our concern 
is to visualize and clarify the principles and peculiarities of the automatatheory and to be the bridge from intellectual 
knowledge to pictorial understanding.

##Future Features
- Push-Down Automaton (PDA)
- different languages (type 1 - 3)
- non-deterministic automata (NDA)
- Turing machine (TA)
